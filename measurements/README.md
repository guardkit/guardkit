# Progressive Disclosure Measurements

This directory contains measurement data for tracking the impact of progressive disclosure implementation.

## Files

- `baseline.json` - Measurement before progressive disclosure implementation
- `after.json` - Measurement after progressive disclosure implementation
- `comparison-report.json` - Comparison analysis showing improvements

## Usage

See `scripts/measure-token-usage.py` for measurement script.

## Note

The `.json` files are gitignored as they contain environment-specific measurements. Only the README is tracked.
