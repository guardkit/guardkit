# GitHub Actions Workflow: Build and Deploy MkDocs Documentation
# Task: TASK-DFFA
# Status: Production-Ready
# Purpose: Automated documentation builds and deployment to GitHub Pages
#
# Triggers:
# - Push to main branch with changes to: docs/, mkdocs.yml, or this workflow
# - Manual workflow_dispatch for on-demand deployments
#
# Architecture: Modern GitHub Pages deployment using actions/deploy-pages@v4
# No gh-pages branch approach - simpler, more maintainable
#
# Security: OIDC-based authentication (zero long-lived secrets)
# Permissions: contents:read, pages:write, id-token:write (least privilege)

name: Build and Deploy MkDocs

on:
  # Automatically trigger on documentation changes
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths:
      - docs/**
      - mkdocs.yml
      - .github/workflows/docs.yml

  # Allow manual triggering from Actions tab
  # Useful for: re-deploying specific versions, recovering from failures
  workflow_dispatch:

# Environment configuration for reuse across jobs
env:
  PYTHON_VERSION: '3.12'
  ARTIFACTS_RETENTION_DAYS: 1  # Short-lived staging artifacts

# Explicit permission grants (least privilege principle)
# Contents: read source code
# Pages: publish to GitHub Pages
# ID-Token: OIDC token generation for secure deployment (no PATs)
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

# Concurrency control: Prevent simultaneous deployments
# Group: 'pages' (singular deployment context)
# Cancel in-progress: Newer pushes cancel older runs
# Reduces race conditions and unnecessary Pages updates

  # ============================================================================
  # BUILD JOB: Compile MkDocs documentation
  # ============================================================================
  build:
    name: Build Documentation
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # --------
      # Step 1: Checkout repository code
      # --------
      # Standard checkout (no custom fetch depth needed for static builds)
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # --------
      # Step 2: Setup Python environment with dependency caching
      # --------
      # Version: Python 3.12 (latest stable for better performance)
      # Cache: pip packages using docs/requirements.txt as key
      # Benefit: 60-80% faster builds when dependencies unchanged
      - name: Setup Python 3.12
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: ${{ env.PYTHON_VERSION }}
          cache: pip
          # Cache key based on requirements.txt hash
          # If requirements.txt unchanged, pip packages restored from cache
          cache-dependency-path: docs/requirements.txt

      # --------
      # Step 3: Upgrade pip and install MkDocs dependencies
      # --------
      # Dependencies:
      # - mkdocs: Core documentation builder
      # - mkdocs-material: Professional Material Design theme
      # - pymdown-extensions: Additional Markdown features (code tabs, emoji, etc.)
      - name: Install MkDocs dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r docs/requirements.txt

      # --------
      # Step 4: Build documentation with strict mode
      # --------
      # Strict mode flags:
      # - Fails on broken links (link validation)
      # - Fails on missing referenced files
      # - Fails on invalid Markdown syntax
      # - Fails on configuration errors
      # Result: site/ directory with complete static HTML site
      # Time: 2-5 seconds (MkDocs is single-threaded)
      - name: Build MkDocs documentation (strict mode)
        run: mkdocs build --strict
        # If this step fails, workflow stops (build job fails)
        # Deploy job never runs (requires successful build)

      # --------
      # Step 5: Upload build artifacts to GitHub Actions storage
      # --------
      # Name: github-pages (matched by deploy job download step)
      # Path: site/ (MkDocs output directory)
      # Retention: 1 day (temporary staging, auto-cleanup)
      # Rationale: Decouple build from deploy
      #           - Build can be retried independently
      #           - Deploy can be retried independently
      #           - Faster overall when artifacts retained
      #           - 1-day retention sufficient for troubleshooting
      - name: Upload build artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: github-pages
          path: site/
          retention-days: ${{ env.ARTIFACTS_RETENTION_DAYS }}

  # ============================================================================
  # DEPLOY JOB: Publish documentation to GitHub Pages
  # ============================================================================
  deploy:
    name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
    needs: build
    # Only run after successful build
    # If build fails, this job is skipped

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Environment configuration
    # Name: github-pages (creates named environment in repo)
    # URL: Displayed in Actions UI and PR deployments
    # Visible in: Settings > Environments > github-pages
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}

    steps:
      # --------
      # Step 1: Configure GitHub Pages for artifact deployment
      # --------
      # Sets up Pages environment and artifact staging area
      # Required before download-artifact step
      - name: Configure GitHub Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v4

      # --------
      # Step 2: Download build artifacts
      # --------
      # Name: github-pages (matches upload-artifact name)
      # Restores site/ directory into current directory
      - name: Download build artifacts
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: github-pages

      # --------
      # Step 3: Deploy to GitHub Pages
      # --------
      # Modern approach: Uses GitHub's built-in Pages deployment
      # Alternative (deprecated): gh-pages branch approach
      # Benefits:
      # - No custom branch management
      # - Automatic Pages refresh
      # - Better security (OIDC, no PATs)
      # - Simpler rollback (just re-run workflow)
      # ID: deployment (allows referencing output for environment URL)
