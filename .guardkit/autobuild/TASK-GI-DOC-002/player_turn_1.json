  "implementation_notes": "Created comprehensive Graphiti setup guide at docs/setup/graphiti-setup.md with:\n\n1. Prerequisites section covering Docker Desktop, Python 3.10+, OpenAI API key, and recommended hardware\n2. Five detailed installation steps:\n   - Step 1: Start Graphiti Services with docker compose\n   - Step 2: Configure environment with OPENAI_API_KEY and optional overrides\n   - Step 3: Verify connection using 'guardkit graphiti status'\n   - Step 4: Seed knowledge using 'guardkit graphiti seed'\n   - Step 5: Verify seeding using 'guardkit graphiti verify --verbose'\n3. Complete configuration file reference with annotated .guardkit/graphiti.yaml example\n4. Comprehensive troubleshooting section covering:\n   - Connection failures (docker ps, logs, restart)\n   - Seeding errors (--force flag, API key checks)\n   - No context in sessions (verification steps)\n   - Common error messages table\n5. Docker Compose reference documenting:\n   - Services started (FalkorDB, Graphiti API)\n   - Port mappings (6379 for FalkorDB, 8000 for Graphiti)\n   - Volume persistence and backup/restore commands\n\nThe guide follows the style of existing MCP setup guides (context7-setup.md, design-patterns-setup.md) with:\n- Step-by-step numbered instructions\n- Expected output examples for all verification commands\n- Copy-paste ready Docker and CLI commands\n- Troubleshooting for each potential failure point\n- Proper markdown structure with internal navigation\n\nAll commands verified against actual CLI implementation in guardkit/cli/graphiti.py and configuration in guardkit/knowledge/config.py.",
