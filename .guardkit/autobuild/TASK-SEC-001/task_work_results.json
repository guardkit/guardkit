    "I'll execute the `/task-work` command for TASK-SEC-001 with `--implement-only` and `--mode=tdd` flags.\n\nLet me start by parsing the flags and locating the task file.",
    "I found the task file in `design_approved` state. Let me read it to verify its state and load the implementation plan:",
    "The task is in `design_approved` state, which is correct for `--implement-only`. Let me check for the implementation plan in different locations:",
    "Let me check for the task plan and explore the current structure:",
    "Now let me read the existing `coach_validator.py` to understand the integration point:",
    "Now I have a clear picture. The task is to create a `SecurityChecker` class that integrates with the `CoachValidator`. The task is in `design_approved` state and I need to execute `--implement-only` mode (Phases 3-5).\n\nLet me display the workflow mode and proceed:\n\n```\n\ud83d\ude80 Workflow Mode: IMPLEMENT-ONLY (Phases 3-5)\n   Using previously approved design\n\n\ud83c\udfaf Development Mode: TDD (test-driven development: red \u2192 green \u2192 refactor)\n\n\ud83d\udccb Task Context Loaded\n   ID: TASK-SEC-001\n   Title: Add quick security checks to Coach agent\n   State: design_approved\n   Priority: high\n   Complexity: 5/10 (Medium)\n\n\ud83d\udcc4 Documentation Level: minimal (default)\n   Estimated time: 8-12 minutes\n```\n\nNow I'll invoke the Task tool to execute Phase 3 (Implementation) with TDD mode. In TDD mode, we first write failing tests, then implement to make them pass.",
    "Excellent! The RED phase is complete with 68 failing tests. Now let me move to the GREEN phase - implementing the SecurityChecker to make the tests pass.",
    "Excellent! The GREEN phase is complete with all 68 tests passing. Let me verify the implementation by reading the created files and then proceed to the REFACTOR phase.",
    "The implementation looks comprehensive. Let me verify the tests and update the __init__.py:",
    "The `__init__.py` already has SecurityChecker and SecurityFinding exported. Now let me proceed to the TDD REFACTOR phase and then run the full test suite:",
    "Excellent! The REFACTOR phase is complete with only one minor improvement (magic number to constant). Now let's move to Phase 4 - running the full test suite and verifying coverage:",
    "All 68 tests pass. Now let me run coverage specifically for the security_checker module:",
    "The coverage isn't reporting correctly because the module path format needs adjustment. Let me try again with the correct coverage path:",
    "Let me check the specific coverage for the security_checker module by reading the test file to understand what's happening:",
    "The SecurityChecker is working correctly. All 68 tests pass. Now let's update the todos and proceed to Phase 4.5 (which is not needed since all tests pass) and Phase 5 (Code Review):",
    "The code review is complete with a score of 92/100 and APPROVED status. Now let me complete the todo list and move the task to IN_REVIEW state:",
    "Now let me move the task file from `design_approved` to `in_review`:"
