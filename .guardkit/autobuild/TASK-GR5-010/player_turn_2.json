  "implementation_notes": "Upon investigation, I found that all documentation for GR-005 was already complete and comprehensive. The task required updating documentation for knowledge query commands and turn state tracking, and I discovered that:\n\n1. CLAUDE.md already contains a complete 'Knowledge Query Commands' section with all four CLI commands (show, search, list, status) documented with examples\n2. Turn state tracking section is comprehensive with schema, benefits, and query examples\n3. Troubleshooting section covers all common issues with actionable solutions\n4. FEAT-GR-005 specification is marked as IMPLEMENTED with complete implementation notes\n5. All CLI commands in guardkit/cli/graphiti.py have comprehensive help text with examples\n\nSince the documentation was already complete, I created comprehensive validation tests (test_gr005_completion.py) that verify all 5 acceptance criteria are met. The tests validate:\n- AC-001: CLI usage in CLAUDE.md\n- AC-002: All query commands documented with examples\n- AC-003: Turn state capture behavior documented\n- AC-004: Troubleshooting for query issues\n- AC-005: FEAT-GR-005 marked as implemented\n\nAll tests passed, confirming the documentation is complete and meets all requirements.",
