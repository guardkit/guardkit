  "implementation_notes": "The implementation_modes retrieval was already fully implemented in the codebase. The feature includes:\n\n1. Query logic in build_context() method (lines 380-384) that queries the 'implementation_modes' group from Graphiti\n2. Formatting logic in _format_implementation_modes() method (lines 225-243) that formats mode, pattern, and description fields\n3. Integration into to_prompt_context() method (lines 110-112) that includes implementation modes in the formatted output\n4. Proper error handling through _safe_search() method that gracefully degrades when Graphiti is unavailable\n\nThe implementation addresses all acceptance criteria:\n- Queries implementation_modes group via GraphitiClient\n- Returns direct and task-work mode guidance\n- Formats mode, pattern (invocation method), and description (result location and pitfalls)\n- Helps prevent file location errors by clarifying worktree vs main repo patterns\n\nAll tests verify the implementation works correctly including edge cases and graceful degradation.",
