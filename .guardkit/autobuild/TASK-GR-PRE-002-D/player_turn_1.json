  "implementation_notes": "Task TASK-GR-PRE-002-D focused on testing and documentation for episode metadata. Upon inspection, I found that all required work was already completed:\n\n1. **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test suite with 31 tests covering:\n   - EpisodeMetadata dataclass creation (6 tests)\n   - Serialization/deserialization (5 tests)\n   - EntityType enum validation (5 tests)\n   - SourceType enum validation (4 tests)\n   - Metadata validation logic (5 tests)\n   - Helper methods (4 tests)\n   - Edge cases and error handling (2 tests)\n\n2. **Test Coverage**: Excellent coverage achieved:\n   - guardkit/integrations/graphiti/constants.py: 100%\n   - guardkit/integrations/graphiti/metadata.py: 93%\n   - Only missing lines are defensive error paths and import fallback code\n\n3. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation already exists:\n   - docs/deep-dives/graphiti/episode-metadata.md (13KB, 585 lines)\n   - Complete schema documentation with examples\n   - Best practices and validation guidance\n   - Integration examples and usage patterns\n\n4. **API Documentation**: The episode-metadata.md file serves as complete API documentation with:\n   - Field-by-field descriptions\n   - Example episodes\n   - Validation logic\n   - Code examples for usage\n\nAll acceptance criteria were already met by previous tasks in the dependency chain (TASK-GR-PRE-002-A and TASK-GR-PRE-002-B).",
