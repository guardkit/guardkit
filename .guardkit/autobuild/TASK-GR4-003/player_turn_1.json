  "implementation_notes": "Implemented the `guardkit graphiti capture` CLI command with full support for interactive knowledge capture sessions. The command integrates with the existing InteractiveCaptureSession from TASK-GR4-002 and provides rich colored console output using the Rich library. Key features: (1) --interactive flag to start session, (2) --focus option to filter by 9 knowledge categories including AutoBuild workflow categories (role-customization, quality-gates, workflow-preferences), (3) --max-questions to limit question count, (4) Comprehensive error handling for disabled Graphiti, connection failures, and session errors, (5) Colored output with cyan for question headers, yellow for questions, green for captured facts, and appropriate status messages.",
