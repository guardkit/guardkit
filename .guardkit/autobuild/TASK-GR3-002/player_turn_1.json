  "implementation_notes": "Implemented FeaturePlanContext dataclass with all required fields including AutoBuild support fields (role_constraints, quality_gate_configs, implementation_modes). The to_prompt_context() method implements budget-aware formatting with prioritized sections (40% feature spec, 20% architecture, 15% related features, 15% patterns, 10% warnings, plus AutoBuild sections). All formatting helper methods include proper truncation limits and handle missing data gracefully. The implementation follows the specification from FEAT-GR-003-feature-spec-integration.md exactly.",
