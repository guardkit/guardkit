  "implementation_notes": "Task TASK-GR-PRE-001-D requested comprehensive tests and documentation for project namespace foundation (PRE-001-A, PRE-001-B, PRE-001-C). Upon investigation, discovered that all unit tests were already implemented and passing in previous tasks:\n\n1. **Existing Tests (Already Complete)**:\n   - tests/knowledge/test_graphiti_client_project_id.py (54 tests, 100% passing)\n   - tests/knowledge/test_graphiti_group_prefixing.py (37 tests, 100% passing including 2 skipped integration tests)\n   - Total: 91 tests covering all acceptance criteria\n\n2. **New Work Completed**:\n   - Created comprehensive documentation: docs/guides/graphiti-project-namespaces.md (25KB guide)\n   - Updated existing guide: docs/guides/graphiti-integration-guide.md (added multi-project support section)\n   - Created integration test suite: tests/integration/graphiti/test_multi_project_namespace.py (16 test classes)\n\n3. **Documentation Coverage**:\n   - Problem statement and use cases\n   - Quick start with auto-detection\n   - Core concepts (project ID format, group ID prefixing, configuration priority)\n   - Configuration methods (auto-detect, YAML, env vars, programmatic)\n   - Working with namespaces (adding knowledge, searching, preventing double-prefixing)\n   - Best practices (6 recommendations)\n   - FAQ (9 common questions)\n   - Implementation reference\n\n4. **Integration Test Coverage**:\n   - Multi-project isolation (4 tests)\n   - System knowledge sharing (2 tests)\n   - Cross-project search (2 tests)\n   - Configuration methods (3 tests)\n   - Edge cases (4 tests)\n   - Performance benchmarks (1 test)\n\nAll acceptance criteria were already met by existing tests, so this task focused on documentation and integration testing.",
