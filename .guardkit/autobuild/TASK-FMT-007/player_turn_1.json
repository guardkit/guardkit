  "implementation_notes": "Created three CLAUDE.md documentation files for fastmcp-python template:\n\n1. Top-level CLAUDE.md (5.8KB): Complete template reference with all 10 critical MCP patterns, architecture overview, technology stack, quick start, and quality scores.\n\n2. .claude/CLAUDE.md (5.1KB): Project-specific quick reference with development workflow, pattern summaries, anti-patterns, and stack-specific guidance.\n\n3. README.md (9.2KB): User-facing documentation with installation instructions, examples, directory structure, quality metrics, and resource links.\n\nAll files follow fastapi-python template structure as reference, adapted for MCP server development. Documentation emphasizes the 10 critical patterns from .claude/rules/mcp-patterns.md:\n- Tool registration at module level\n- stderr logging (stdout reserved for protocol)\n- Streaming two-layer architecture\n- CancelledError handling\n- String parameter conversion\n- Timezone-aware datetime\n- FastMCP framework (not custom)\n- Error propagation boundaries\n- Resource URI patterns\n- Async context injection\n\nComprehensive test suite validates all acceptance criteria with 26 tests covering file existence, content quality, pattern coverage, and cross-references.",
