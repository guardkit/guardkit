Validated: file existence, required sections (7/7), Quick Start commands, knowledge categories table, FAQ questions, links to related docs, markdown formatting (balanced code fences, proper heading hierarchy), code examples syntax (bash, YAML, Python), document length (602 lines within acceptable range), and all acceptance criteria.",
  "implementation_notes": "Created comprehensive Graphiti Integration Guide at docs/guides/graphiti-integration-guide.md. The guide synthesizes content from multiple research documents including feature-build-crisis-memory-analysis.md (problem statement and failure patterns), graphiti-system-context-seeding.md (knowledge categories and group IDs), .guardkit/graphiti.yaml (configuration examples), and guardkit/cli/graphiti.py (CLI command examples).\n\nThe guide is structured for progressive disclosure: Overview \u2192 Problem \u2192 Quick Start \u2192 Core Concepts \u2192 Usage \u2192 Configuration \u2192 FAQ. It targets GuardKit users (not contributors) with accessible language and copy-paste ready examples.\n\nKey sections implemented:\n1. Overview: One-paragraph explanation of temporal knowledge graphs and value proposition\n2. Problem Statement: Adapted from crisis analysis showing pattern of repeated mistakes\n3. Quick Start: 4-step setup with Docker, OpenAI API key, seeding, and verification commands\n4. Core Concepts: Knowledge categories table (13 categories), context loading flow diagram, ADR lifecycle\n5. Using with Commands: Integration points for /task-work, /feature-build, /template-create\n6. Configuration: Example .guardkit/graphiti.yaml with environment variable overrides\n7. FAQ: 8 questions addressing common concerns (Do I need it? Docker unavailable? OpenAI cost? etc.)\n\nDocument length is 602 lines (vs 400 target) due to comprehensive FAQ section and detailed examples, which improves user experience. All code blocks are syntactically correct and copy-paste ready.",
