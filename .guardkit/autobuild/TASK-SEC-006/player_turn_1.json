Key changes: (1) Added Security Validation (Read-Only) section to autobuild-coach.md clarifying Coach only reads security results, never invokes agents; (2) Added comprehensive Security Validation section to feature-build.md with configuration examples, security levels table, quick checks reference, excluded finding types, and confidence scoring; (3) Added Security Validation summary to CLAUDE.md AutoBuild section; (4) Created complete security-validation.md guide with architecture diagram showing Phase 2.5C (pre-loop) and Phase 4.3 (task-work), integration details, best practices, and example workflows; (5) Documented excluded finding types (DOS, rate limiting, memory leaks, open redirect) and confidence threshold (0.8) per TASK-REV-SEC2; (6) Created comprehensive test suite (16 tests) validating all documentation for accuracy, syntax, cross-references, and consistency.",
