Two targeted changes made: (1) Added logger.warning() in _build_synthetic_report() to log turn number, file counts, test count, and note about missing completion_promises. (2) Added _synthetic: True flag to report dict. (3) Added warning log before Coach invocation in _execute_turn() when report is synthetic. All changes are minimal, focused, and informational-only (no behavioral changes).",
