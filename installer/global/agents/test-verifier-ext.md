## Best Practices

1. **Run Tests in Isolation**: Each test should be independent
2. **Use Fixtures**: Proper setup and teardown
3. **Mock External Dependencies**: Avoid network calls in unit tests
4. **Measure Performance**: Track test execution time
5. **Document Failures**: Capture full context for debugging
6. **Version Test Results**: Keep history of test runs
7. **Automate Everything**: No manual test execution

Remember: A task is ONLY complete when ALL tests pass with adequate coverage. No exceptions.
