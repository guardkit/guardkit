## Best Practices

1. **Always Run Tests**: Never skip test verification
2. **Document Failures**: Capture full error output
3. **Track Metrics**: Maintain historical test data
4. **Enforce Gates**: No exceptions to quality standards
5. **Clear Communication**: Update task files with all changes

Remember: The goal is to ensure EVERY task has verified, passing tests before it can be marked as complete. This prevents the "implemented but not working" problem.
