# Task Review - Structured Analysis and Decision-Making

Execute structured review and analysis workflows for tasks that require assessment, evaluation, or decision-making rather than implementation.

## Command Syntax

```bash
/task-review TASK-XXX [--mode=MODE] [--depth=DEPTH] [--output=FORMAT]
```

## Overview

The `/task-review` command provides a dedicated workflow for analysis and decision-making tasks, separate from the implementation-focused `/task-work` command.

**Use `/task-review` for**:
- Architectural reviews and assessments
- Code quality evaluations
- Technical decision analysis
- Technical debt assessment
- Security audits
- Root cause analysis

**Use `/task-work` for**:
- Feature implementation
- Bug fixes
- Refactoring
- Test creation

## Automatic Review Task Detection

When creating tasks with `/task-create`, the system automatically detects review/analysis tasks and suggests using `/task-review` instead of `/task-work`.

### Detection Criteria

A task is detected as a review task if **any** of the following conditions are met:

1. **Explicit task_type field**: `task_type:review` parameter
2. **Decision required flag**: `decision_required:true` parameter
3. **Review-related tags**: `architecture-review`, `code-review`, `decision-point`, `assessment`
4. **Title keywords**: `review`, `analyze`, `evaluate`, `assess`, `audit`, `investigation`

### Suggestion Behavior

When a review task is detected during `/task-create`, you'll see:

```
=========================================================================
REVIEW TASK DETECTED
=========================================================================

Task: Review authentication architecture

This appears to be a review/analysis task.

Suggested workflow:
  1. Create task: /task-create (current command)
  2. Execute review: /task-review TASK-XXX
  3. (Optional) Implement findings: /task-work TASK-YYY

Note: /task-work is for implementation, /task-review is for analysis.
=========================================================================

Create task? [Y/n]:
```

**Important**: The suggestion is **informational only** and doesn't block task creation. You can still create the task and use `/task-work` if desired, though `/task-review` is recommended for analysis tasks.

### Detection Examples

**Example 1: Explicit task_type**
```bash
/task-create "Architectural review of authentication system" task_type:review
# ✅ Detected: Explicit task_type field
```

**Example 2: Decision required flag**
```bash
/task-create "Should we migrate to microservices?" decision_required:true
# ✅ Detected: Decision flag indicates review/analysis needed
```

**Example 3: Review tags**
```bash
/task-create "Code quality assessment" tags:[code-review,assessment]
# ✅ Detected: Tags indicate review task
```

**Example 4: Title keywords**
```bash
/task-create "Evaluate caching strategy options"
# ✅ Detected: "Evaluate" keyword in title
```

**Example 5: Not a review task**
```bash
/task-create "Implement user authentication"
# ❌ Not detected: Implementation task, no review indicators
# Suggestion not shown, proceeds normally
```

### Why Detection Helps

1. **Command Selection**: Helps you choose `/task-review` vs `/task-work`
2. **Workflow Efficiency**: Review tasks skip implementation phases
3. **Better Reports**: Review mode generates structured analysis reports
4. **Decision Support**: Review tasks include decision checkpoints ([A]ccept/[R]evise/[I]mplement/[C]ancel)

### Overriding Detection

If you want to use `/task-work` for a task that was detected as review:

```bash
# Task detected as review, but you want implementation workflow
/task-create "Review authentication architecture"
# [Suggestion shown]
# Choose Y to create task

# Use /task-work instead of /task-review
/task-work TASK-XXX
# Works fine, detection is only a suggestion
```

## Workflow Phases

The `/task-review` command executes these phases automatically:

### Phase 1: Load Review Context
- Read task description and acceptance criteria
- Identify review scope and objectives
- Load relevant codebase files/modules
- Load related design documents and ADRs

### Phase 2: Execute Review Analysis
- Invoke appropriate review agents based on mode
- Perform analysis using specialized prompts
- Generate findings with supporting evidence
- Score/rate based on review criteria

### Phase 3: Synthesize Recommendations
- Aggregate findings from multiple agents (if applicable)
- Generate actionable recommendations
- Identify decision options (for decision-making tasks)
- Prioritize recommendations by impact

### Phase 4: Generate Review Report
- Create structured markdown report
- Include executive summary
- Document findings with evidence
- Provide recommendations with rationale
- Attach supporting artifacts (diagrams, metrics)

### Phase 5: Human Decision Checkpoint
Present findings to user with decision options:
- **[A]ccept** - Approve findings, mark task as `REVIEW_COMPLETE`
- **[R]evise** - Request deeper analysis on specific areas
- **[I]mplement** - Create implementation task based on recommendation
- **[C]ancel** - Discard review, return task to backlog

## Model Selection Strategy

The `/task-review` command automatically selects the optimal Claude model based on review mode and depth, balancing cost efficiency with quality requirements.

### When Opus 4.5 Is Used

**Opus 4.5** provides superior reasoning for high-value scenarios:

1. **Security reviews** (all depths) - Security breaches cost $100K-$10M, model costs $1-5
2. **Decision analysis** (standard/comprehensive) - Complex trade-offs require deep reasoning
3. **Comprehensive architectural reviews** - Thorough SOLID/DRY/YAGNI analysis
4. **Comprehensive technical debt** - Nuanced effort vs impact prioritization

**Cost**: $0.45-$1.65 per review (67% premium vs Sonnet)

### When Sonnet 4.5 Is Used

**Sonnet 4.5** provides excellent quality for most scenarios:

1. **Quick reviews** (except security) - Speed matters
2. **Code quality reviews** (all depths) - Metrics are objective
3. **Standard architectural reviews** - Pattern-based analysis sufficient
4. **Standard technical debt** - Straightforward prioritization

**Cost**: $0.09-$0.68 per review

### Cost Transparency

Before each review, you'll see:
```
======================================================================
📊 Review Cost Estimate
======================================================================
Model: claude-opus-4-20250514
Estimated tokens: 150,000
Estimated cost: $1.13
Rationale: comprehensive depth requires deep analysis,
           security reviews always use Opus 4.5
======================================================================
```

This ensures you always know which model will be used and why.

## Integration with /task-work

The `/task-review` command integrates seamlessly with `/task-work` to support a complete review → implementation → verification workflow.

### Review → Implementation Workflow

**Step 1: Create Review Task**
```bash
/task-create "Review authentication architecture" task_type:review
# Output: Created TASK-REV-A3F2
```

**Step 2: Execute Review**
```bash
/task-review TASK-REV-A3F2 --mode=architectural --depth=standard
# Review runs, generates report at .claude/reviews/TASK-REV-A3F2-review-report.md
# Task status: BACKLOG → IN_PROGRESS → REVIEW_COMPLETE
```

**Step 3: Decision Checkpoint**

After review completion, you'll see:

```
=========================================================================
REVIEW COMPLETE: TASK-REV-A3F2
=========================================================================

### What [I]mplement Does

When you choose [I]mplement, the system automatically:

1. **Extracts feature slug** from review title (e.g., "Authentication Refactor" → "authentication-refactor")
2. **Parses subtasks** from review recommendations section
3. **Assigns implementation modes** (task-work/direct/manual) based on complexity and risk
4. **Detects parallel groups** by analyzing file conflicts between tasks
5. **Generates workspace names** for Conductor parallel execution
6. **Creates subfolder** at `tasks/backlog/{feature-slug}/`
7. **Generates task files** with complete frontmatter and metadata
8. **Generates IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md** with wave breakdowns and execution strategy
9. **Generates README.md** with problem statement, solution approach, and subtask summary
10. **Displays execution plan** with next steps

### Enhanced [I]mplement Benefits

**Before (Manual)**:
- Manually create each implementation task
- Guess at implementation modes
- No parallel execution strategy
- No documentation generated

**After (Auto-Detection)**:
- Zero manual task creation
- Smart mode assignment (task-work/direct/manual)
- Automatic parallel group detection
- Complete documentation generated
- Conductor-ready workspace names

**Step 5: Implement Changes**
```bash
/task-work TASK-IMP-B4D1
# Executes implementation with all quality gates:
# - Phase 2: Planning
# - Phase 2.5: Architectural Review
# - Phase 3: Implementation
# - Phase 4: Testing
# - Phase 4.5: Test Enforcement
# - Phase 5: Code Review
```

**Step 6: Verification Review (Optional)**

After implementation, create verification review:

```bash
/task-create "Verify authentication refactoring from TASK-IMP-B4D1" task_type:review
# Output: Created TASK-VER-C5E3

/task-review TASK-VER-C5E3 --mode=code-quality --depth=quick
# Quick verification that changes meet original recommendations
```

### Task State Flow

```
Review Task:
  BACKLOG → IN_PROGRESS → REVIEW_COMPLETE → COMPLETED

Implementation Task (created from [I]mplement):
  BACKLOG → IN_PROGRESS → IN_REVIEW → COMPLETED

Verification Task (optional):
  BACKLOG → IN_PROGRESS → REVIEW_COMPLETE → COMPLETED
```

### Real-World Example: Security Audit

```bash
# 1. Security audit review
/task-create "Security audit of payment processing" task_type:review
/task-review TASK-SEC-D7E2 --mode=security --depth=comprehensive

# 2. Review identifies 12 vulnerabilities
# Decision: [I]mplement

# 3. System creates implementation task
# TASK-IMP-E8F3: Fix security vulnerabilities from TASK-SEC-D7E2

# 4. Implement fixes
/task-work TASK-IMP-E8F3

# 5. Verification review
/task-create "Verify security fixes from TASK-IMP-E8F3" task_type:review
/task-review TASK-VER-F9G4 --mode=security --depth=standard

# 6. Verification passes, close all tasks
/task-complete TASK-VER-F9G4
/task-complete TASK-IMP-E8F3
/task-complete TASK-SEC-D7E2
```

### Benefits of Integration

1. **Traceability**: Implementation tasks linked to review findings
2. **Context Preservation**: Review report available during implementation
3. **Consistent Quality**: Implementation goes through all quality gates
4. **Verification Loop**: Optional verification review closes the cycle
5. **Automated Task Creation**: [I]mplement option eliminates manual task creation

## Task States and Transitions

```
BACKLOG → IN_PROGRESS → REVIEW_COMPLETE → Completed/Implemented
              ↓
           BLOCKED
```

**States**:
- `BACKLOG`: Review task not started
- `IN_PROGRESS`: Review in progress
- `REVIEW_COMPLETE`: Review finished, awaiting human decision
- `BLOCKED`: Review cannot proceed (missing context, access issues)

**After Review**:
- Accept findings → Task archived as completed
- Create implementation task → New task in backlog linked to review

## Task Metadata

Review tasks use extended metadata fields:

```yaml
---
id: TASK-XXX
title: Review authentication architecture
status: in_progress
task_type: review                    # NEW: review | implementation | research | docs
review_mode: architectural           # NEW: architectural | code-quality | decision | etc.
review_depth: standard               # NEW: quick | standard | comprehensive
priority: high
tags: [architecture, security]
---
```

After review completion:

```yaml
---
id: TASK-XXX
status: review_complete
review_results:                      # NEW: Added after review
  score: 72
  findings_count: 8
  recommendations_count: 5
  decision: refactor
  report_path: .claude/reviews/TASK-XXX-review-report.md
---
```

## Integration with Task States

### Creating Review Tasks

```bash
# Create review task
/task-create "Review authentication architecture" task_type:review

# Task created with task_type=review in frontmatter
```

### Executing Review

```bash
# Execute review (automatically detects task_type=review)
/task-review TASK-XXX --mode=architectural

# Review runs, generates report, updates task metadata
```

### Post-Review Actions

**Option 1: Accept findings (archive task)**
```bash
# User chooses [A]ccept at checkpoint
# Task moved to completed, report archived
```

**Option 2: Create implementation task**
```bash
# User chooses [I]mplement at checkpoint
# New task created in backlog:
# /task-create "Refactor authentication based on TASK-XXX findings" related_to:TASK-XXX
```

**Option 3: Revise review**
```bash
# User chooses [R]evise at checkpoint
# Review re-runs with additional focus areas
/task-review TASK-XXX --mode=architectural --depth=comprehensive
```

## Execution Protocol

### Prerequisites
1. Task must exist in `tasks/` directory
2. Task must have `task_type: review` in frontmatter (optional, defaults to review)
3. Review scope must be defined in task description

### Validation
- Validates `--mode` against allowed values
- Validates `--depth` against allowed values
- Validates `--output` against allowed values
- Checks task exists and is accessible

### Error Handling

**Common Errors**:

```bash
# Invalid review mode
❌ Error: Invalid review mode 'invalid-mode'
   Allowed: architectural, code-quality, decision, technical-debt, security

# Task not found
❌ Error: Task TASK-XXX not found in any task directory

# Missing review scope
❌ Error: Task TASK-XXX missing review scope in description
   Add "Review Scope" section to task description

# Insufficient context
⚠️  Warning: Review scope references non-existent files
   Proceeding with available context
```

## Best Practices

### When to Use `/task-review`

**Use for**:
- ✅ "Should we implement X?" (decision analysis)
- ✅ "Review the architecture of X" (architectural review)
- ✅ "Assess code quality of X" (code quality review)
- ✅ "Identify technical debt in X" (technical debt assessment)
- ✅ "Audit security of X" (security audit)

**Don't use for**:
- ❌ "Implement feature X" (use `/task-work`)
- ❌ "Fix bug in X" (use `/task-work`)
- ❌ "Refactor X" (use `/task-work`)

### Review Depth Selection

**Quick** (15-30 min):
- Initial assessment
- Sanity check before major work
- High-level overview for stakeholders

**Standard** (1-2 hours):
- Regular code reviews
- Architecture assessments
- Decision analysis for medium complexity

**Comprehensive** (4-6 hours):
- Security audits
- Critical architectural decisions
- Large-scale refactoring planning
- Compliance assessments

### Output Format Selection

**Summary**:
- Executive presentations
- Quick decision-making
- Stakeholder communication

**Detailed**:
- Technical team consumption
- Implementation planning
- Audit trail

**Presentation**:
- Architecture reviews with stakeholders
- Decision presentations
- Training materials

## Advanced Usage

### Chaining Reviews and Implementation

```bash
# 1. Architectural review
/task-review TASK-001 --mode=architectural

# 2. Based on findings, create implementation task
/task-create "Refactor auth based on TASK-001" related_to:TASK-001

# 3. Implement refactoring
/task-work TASK-002

# 4. Post-implementation review
/task-review TASK-003 --mode=code-quality
```

### Iterative Review Refinement

```bash
# 1. Quick initial assessment
/task-review TASK-XXX --depth=quick

# 2. Based on findings, go deeper
/task-review TASK-XXX --depth=comprehensive --focus="authentication layer"
```

## Implementation Notes

### Enhanced [I]mplement Flow (TASK-FW-008)

The enhanced [I]mplement option requires integration with `lib.implement_orchestrator`:

```python
from lib.implement_orchestrator import handle_implement_option

# When user chooses [I]mplement at decision checkpoint
await handle_implement_option(
    review_task=review_task_dict,
    review_report_path=".claude/reviews/TASK-XXX-review-report.md"
)
```

**Dependencies** (from Wave 2 tasks):
- FW-002: Feature slug extraction (`lib.id_generator`)
- FW-003: Subtask extraction (`lib.review_parser`)
- FW-004: Implementation mode assignment (`lib.implementation_mode_analyzer`)
- FW-005: Parallel group detection (`lib.parallel_analyzer`)
- FW-006: Guide generation (`lib.guide_generator`)
- FW-007: README generation (`lib.readme_generator`)
