# Feature Plan - Single Command Feature Planning

Orchestrates the feature planning workflow in a single user-facing command by automatically creating a review task and executing the decision-making analysis.

## Command Syntax

```bash
/feature-plan "feature description"
```

## Available Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--no-questions` | Skip all clarification (review scope + implementation prefs) |
| `--with-questions` | Force clarification even for simple features |
| `--defaults` | Use clarification defaults throughout workflow |
| `--answers="..."` | Inline answers (propagated to task-review and subtask creation) |

## Clarification Integration

The `/feature-plan` command orchestrates `/task-review` under the hood, so clarification questions flow automatically at two key points in the workflow.

### Phase Flow with Clarification Points

### Context A: Review Scope Clarification

**When**: During Step 2 (Execute Task Review), before analysis begins.

**Purpose**: Clarify what the review should focus on and what trade-offs to prioritize.

**Questions Asked**:
1. **Review Focus** - What aspects to analyze (all/technical/architecture/performance/security)
2. **Analysis Depth** - How thorough to be (quick/standard/deep)
3. **Trade-off Priority** - What to optimize for (speed/quality/cost/maintainability/balanced)

**Gating**: Context A triggers for decision mode tasks (which feature-plan uses) unless `--no-questions` is specified.

### Context B: Implementation Preferences

**When**: At Step 4, after user chooses [I]mplement at decision checkpoint.

**Purpose**: Clarify how subtasks should be created and executed.

**Questions Asked**:
1. **Approach Selection** - Which recommended approach to follow (from review options)
2. **Execution Preference** - Parallel vs sequential execution (Conductor integration)
3. **Testing Depth** - Testing rigor for subtasks (TDD/standard/minimal/default)

**Gating**: Context B triggers when 2+ subtasks will be created, unless `--no-questions` is specified.

Decision: I (choosing [I]mplement with --no-questions skips preferences)

Generating feature structure with defaults...
  - Approach: Recommended option (auto-selected)
  - Execution: Auto-detect (parallel where safe)
  - Testing: Default based on complexity

├── IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md
├── TASK-DM-001-add-css-variables.md
├── TASK-DM-002-create-theme-context.md
└── ...
```

### Example: Force Clarification

For simple features where you still want explicit control:

```bash
/feature-plan "add logout button" --with-questions

# Forces Context A and Context B questions even for simple feature
# Useful for learning workflows or when defaults may not be appropriate
```

### Example: Inline Answers for CI/CD

```bash
/feature-plan "add caching layer" --answers="focus:technical tradeoff:speed approach:1 execution:sequential testing:minimal"

# All clarification questions answered inline
# Useful for automated pipelines or repeatable workflows
```

### Clarification Propagation

When `/feature-plan` calls `/task-review`, clarification flags propagate automatically:

```python
# Pseudo-code for feature-plan orchestration
def execute_feature_plan(description: str, flags: dict):
    # Create review task
    task_id = create_review_task(description)

    # Execute task-review with propagated flags
    review_flags = {
        'no_questions': flags.get('no_questions'),
        'with_questions': flags.get('with_questions'),
        'defaults': flags.get('defaults'),
        'answers': flags.get('answers'),
    }

    # Task-review handles Context A clarification (Phase 1)
    # and Context B clarification (at [I]mplement)
    result = execute_task_review(
        task_id,
        mode='decision',
        depth='standard',
        flags=review_flags
    )

    # Generate feature structure using clarification context
    if result.decision == 'implement':
        generate_feature_structure(
            findings=result.findings,
            clarification=result.clarification,  # Contains both Context A & B decisions
            approach=result.clarification.get('approach'),
            execution=result.clarification.get('execution'),
            testing=result.clarification.get('testing')
        )
```

### Clarification Decision Persistence

Clarification decisions are saved to the review task's frontmatter for audit trail:

```yaml
---
id: TASK-REV-a3f8
title: Plan: add user authentication
status: review_complete
clarification:
  context_a:
    timestamp: 2025-12-08T14:30:00Z
    decisions:
      focus: all
      tradeoff: quality
  context_b:
    timestamp: 2025-12-08T14:35:00Z
    decisions:
      approach: jwt_refresh_tokens
      execution: parallel
      testing: standard
---
```

This enables:
- Audit trail of planning decisions
- Reproducibility if feature needs re-planning
- Understanding why specific subtask configuration was chosen

### Benefits of Clarification in Feature Planning

1. **Focused Analysis** - Context A ensures review covers what matters most
2. **Explicit Approach Selection** - Context B eliminates ambiguity about which option to implement
3. **Optimized Execution** - Parallelization preferences captured upfront
4. **Appropriate Testing** - Testing depth set based on user priorities
5. **Reduced Rework** - ~15% reduction from incorrect assumptions

## Overview

The `/feature-plan` command streamlines feature planning by combining task creation and review analysis into a single workflow. It automatically:

1. Creates a review task with `task_type:review` flag
2. Executes `/task-review` with decision-making analysis
3. Presents decision options based on findings
4. Optionally creates implementation tasks from recommendations

This is a **quick win** command that provides a superior user experience by eliminating manual orchestration.

## Examples

```bash
# Basic feature planning
/feature-plan "implement dark mode"

# Plan a complex feature
/feature-plan "add real-time notifications with WebSocket support"

# Plan infrastructure change
/feature-plan "migrate from REST to GraphQL API"

# Plan security enhancement
/feature-plan "implement OAuth2 authentication"
```

## Execution Flow

When you run `/feature-plan "implement dark mode"`, the system automatically performs:

### Step 1: Create Review Task

Internally executes:
```bash
/task-create "Plan: implement dark mode" task_type:review priority:high
```

The system captures the generated task ID (e.g., `TASK-REV-A3F2`) from the output.

**Output**:
```
✅ Feature planning task created: TASK-REV-A3F2
📋 Title: Plan: implement dark mode
📁 Location: tasks/backlog/TASK-REV-A3F2-plan-implement-dark-mode.md

Proceeding to review analysis...
```

### Step 2: Execute Decision Review

Internally executes:
```bash
/task-review TASK-REV-A3F2 --mode=decision --depth=standard
```

The review analyzes:
- **Technical options** for implementing the feature
- **Architecture implications** and design patterns
- **Effort estimation** and complexity assessment
- **Risk analysis** and potential blockers
- **Dependencies** and prerequisites
- **Recommended approach** with justification

**Output**:
```
🔍 Analyzing feature: implement dark mode

TECHNICAL OPTIONS ANALYSIS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Option 1: CSS Variables + Theme Context (Recommended)
  Complexity: Medium (6/10)
  Effort: 4-6 hours
  Pros:
    ✅ Standard React pattern for theme management
    ✅ CSS variables provide browser-native performance
    ✅ Easy to extend with additional themes later
    ✅ SSR-compatible (Next.js, Remix)
  Cons:
    ⚠️ Requires context setup and provider wrapping
    ⚠️ Manual theme persistence (localStorage/cookies)
  Dependencies:
    - React Context API (built-in)
    - CSS custom properties (browser support: 98%+)

Option 2: Tailwind Dark Mode + Local Storage
  Complexity: Low (3/10)
  Effort: 2-3 hours
  Pros:
    ✅ Minimal setup if using Tailwind already
    ✅ Automatic class switching
    ✅ Built-in dark mode utilities
  Cons:

    ⚠️ Less flexible for complex theming needs
  Dependencies:
    - Tailwind CSS v3+ (project dependency)

Option 3: Styled-components ThemeProvider
  Complexity: Medium (5/10)
  Effort: 3-5 hours
  Pros:
    ✅ Type-safe theme definitions
    ✅ Scoped styling with theme access
    ✅ SSR support built-in
  Cons:
    ⚠️ Adds CSS-in-JS runtime overhead
    ⚠️ Requires styled-components setup if not using
  Dependencies:
    - styled-components v5+

RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ Option 1: CSS Variables + Theme Context

RATIONALE:
  - Standard pattern with broad framework support
  - Performance-efficient with native CSS
  - Easy to test and maintain
  - Aligns with modern React best practices

IMPLEMENTATION BREAKDOWN:
1. Create ThemeContext and provider (1-2 hours)
2. Define CSS variables for light/dark themes (1-2 hours)
3. Implement theme toggle component (1 hour)
4. Add theme persistence with localStorage (30 min)
5. Update existing components to use theme variables (1-2 hours)

ESTIMATED EFFORT: 4-6 hours
COMPLEXITY: 6/10 (Medium)
RISK LEVEL: Low
```

✅ **Automatic orchestration** of task creation + review
✅ **Clear decision options** with full context
✅ **Enhanced [I]mplement** creates subtasks + guide + folder
✅ **Quick planning** for any feature idea

### Technical Benefits

✅ **Structured analysis** of technical options
✅ **Effort estimation** before commitment
✅ **Risk identification** early in planning
✅ **Architecture guidance** for implementation
✅ **Task breakdown** from single feature description

## Advanced Usage

### Planning with Context

```bash
# Include priority in feature description
/feature-plan "URGENT: implement rate limiting for API endpoints"

# The system will:
# - Set priority:critical on review task
# - Flag as high-risk change
# - Recommend comprehensive depth analysis
```

### Re-planning Existing Review

```bash
# Re-run analysis on existing review task
/feature-plan TASK-REV-A3F2

# Useful when:
# - Initial review needs refinement
# - Requirements changed
# - Want to explore different options
```

### Planning Complex Features

```bash
# Complex feature triggers comprehensive review automatically
/feature-plan "migrate monolith to microservices architecture"

# System detects complexity and:
# - Uses --depth=comprehensive
# - Extends time estimates
# - Recommends multi-phase breakdown
```

## Integration with Workflow

### Complete Feature Planning Flow

```bash
# 1. Plan the feature
/feature-plan "add user notifications"
# System creates TASK-REV-B4C2, runs analysis, presents options

# 2. Choose [I]mplement at decision checkpoint
# System creates:
#   - Feature subfolder: tasks/backlog/feature-user-notifications/
#   - Subtasks: TASK-B4C2.1 through TASK-B4C2.5
#   - Implementation guide with architecture notes

# 3. Work through implementation tasks
/task-work TASK-B4C2.1  # Implement notification data model
/task-complete TASK-B4C2.1

/task-work TASK-B4C2.2  # Create notification service
/task-complete TASK-B4C2.2

# ... continue through all subtasks ...

# 4. Verify feature complete
/task-status --filter=feature:user-notifications
# Shows all subtasks and completion status
```

### Quick Evaluation Flow

```bash
# 1. Quick feature evaluation (don't commit yet)
/feature-plan "add GraphQL API alongside REST"

# 2. Review findings at decision checkpoint
# Choose [A]ccept to save analysis for later

# 3. Reference saved plan when ready
# Plan saved in tasks/in_review/TASK-REV-XXX.md
# Use /task-create to link implementation to review
```

## Error Handling

### Empty Feature Description

```bash
/feature-plan ""

❌ ERROR: Feature description required

Usage:
  /feature-plan "feature description"

Examples:
  /feature-plan "implement dark mode"
  /feature-plan "add WebSocket support for real-time updates"
```

### Task Creation Failed

```bash
/feature-plan "duplicate feature that already exists"

❌ ERROR: Task creation failed

A review task with similar title already exists:
- TASK-REV-A1B2: Plan: duplicate feature (backlog)

Suggestions:
- Use a more specific feature description
- Review existing plan: /task-review TASK-REV-A1B2
- Cancel existing plan if no longer needed
```

### Review Execution Failed

```bash
/feature-plan "implement new feature"

✅ Feature planning task created: TASK-REV-C3D4

❌ ERROR: Review execution failed

The review task was created but analysis failed.

You can:
1. Retry analysis: /task-review TASK-REV-C3D4
2. Review task manually: Read tasks/backlog/TASK-REV-C3D4.md
3. Cancel plan: /task-cancel TASK-REV-C3D4
```

## Implementation Notes

### Markdown Orchestration (No SDK Required)

This command uses **markdown instruction expansion** - the slash command file contains instructions that Claude Code interprets and executes. No Python/SDK code is required.

**How It Works**:
1. User runs `/feature-plan "description"`
2. Claude Code reads this markdown file
3. Instructions in "Execution Flow" section guide Claude's actions
4. Claude executes internal commands as described
5. Output follows the format specified in examples

**Key Insight**: Slash commands are just markdown files with instructions for Claude. This makes `/feature-plan` trivial to implement - no code changes needed!

### Task ID Capture

The command must parse task ID from `/task-create` output:

```
✅ Task Created: TASK-REV-A3F2
```

Pattern to extract: `TASK-[A-Z0-9-]+` after "Task Created:"

### Decision Checkpoint Integration

The `/task-review` command with `--mode=decision` automatically presents the decision checkpoint. This command doesn't need to implement the checkpoint logic - it's inherited from `/task-review`.

### Enhanced [I]mplement Option

When user chooses [I]mplement, the system should:
1. Create feature subfolder: `tasks/backlog/feature-{slugified-name}/`
2. Generate subtasks based on implementation breakdown
3. Create `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` with architecture notes
4. Move original review task to completed state

## Best Practices

### Feature Description Guidelines

**Good descriptions** (specific, actionable):
```bash
/feature-plan "implement OAuth2 authentication with Google provider"
/feature-plan "add real-time collaboration using WebSockets"
/feature-plan "migrate PostgreSQL database to Aurora Serverless"
```

**Poor descriptions** (too vague):
```bash
/feature-plan "make app better"           # Too vague
/feature-plan "fix stuff"                  # Not a feature
/feature-plan "users want notifications"   # Incomplete context
```

### When to Use `/feature-plan`

✅ **Use for**:
- New feature ideas needing evaluation
- Architecture decisions requiring analysis
- Complex changes needing breakdown
- Features with multiple implementation approaches

❌ **Don't use for**:
- Simple bug fixes (use `/task-create` + `/task-work`)
- Obvious implementations (use `/task-create` directly)
- Features already planned (use `/task-work` on existing tasks)

### Iteration and Refinement

```bash
# Initial plan
/feature-plan "add caching layer"
# [Choose [A]ccept to save initial analysis]

# Later: Revisit with more context
/feature-plan TASK-REV-A3F2
# [Review re-analyzes with updated project state]
# [Choose [R]evise to explore alternatives]
# [Choose [I]mplement when ready to execute]
```

## Related Commands

- `/task-create` - Create tasks directly (when planning not needed)

## CRITICAL EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE

When the user runs `/feature-plan "description"`, you MUST:

### Execution Steps

1. ✅ **Parse feature description** from command arguments
2. ✅ **Execute `/task-create`** with:
   - Title: "Plan: {description}"
   - Flags: `task_type:review priority:high`
3. ✅ **Capture task ID** from output (regex: `TASK-[A-Z0-9-]+`)
4. ✅ **Execute `/task-review`** with captured task ID:
   - Flags: `--mode=decision --depth=standard`
5. ✅ **Present decision checkpoint** (inherited from `/task-review`)
6. ✅ **Handle user decision**:
   - [A]ccept: Save review, show reference message
   - [R]evise: Re-run review with additional focus
   - [I]mplement: Create subfolder + subtasks + guide
   - [C]ancel: Move to cancelled state

### What NOT to Do

❌ **DO NOT** skip task creation step
❌ **DO NOT** skip review execution step
❌ **DO NOT** implement the feature directly
❌ **DO NOT** bypass decision checkpoint
❌ **DO NOT** create implementation files without [I]mplement choice

### Error Handling

If `/task-create` fails:
- Show clear error message
- Provide suggestions (duplicate check, etc.)
- Stop execution (don't proceed to review)

If `/task-review` fails:
- Show task was created successfully
- Provide retry instructions
- Preserve review task for manual execution

### Example Execution Trace

```
User: /feature-plan "implement dark mode"

Claude executes internally:
  1. /task-create "Plan: implement dark mode" task_type:review priority:high
     → Captures: TASK-REV-A3F2
  2. /task-review TASK-REV-A3F2 --mode=decision --depth=standard
     → Runs analysis, presents options
  3. User chooses: I
  4. Creates structure:
     - Feature folder
     - Subtasks
     - Implementation guide
  5. Shows completion summary
```

This is a **coordination command** - it orchestrates existing commands rather than implementing new logic. Follow the execution flow exactly as specified.
