**Known Patterns**:
- ✅ Command-line tool usage (`/template-validate`)
- ✅ Report aggregation and analysis
- ✅ Quality assessment frameworks
- ✅ Documentation creation

**New Patterns**:
- ⚠️ 16-section audit framework (well-documented but extensive)
- ⚠️ Interactive audit process (may have learning curve)

**Technology Stack**: Markdown, Bash, existing Python CLI
- Familiar technologies
- Well-documented command interface
- Clear examples provided

**Assessment**: Mostly familiar patterns with some learning required for audit framework.

**Score**: 1/2 (somewhat familiar, minor learning curve)

---

### 3. Risk Assessment: 2/3

**Low Risk Factors**:
- ✅ Dependency (TASK-044) is complete and verified
- ✅ Command exists and is tested (109 tests passing)
- ✅ Well-documented process
- ✅ Clear deliverables
- ✅ No code implementation required

**Medium Risk Factors**:
- ⚠️ Manual audit process (time-consuming, 2-3 hours per template)
- ⚠️ Potential for discovered templates beyond expected 9
- ⚠️ Subjective elements in some audit sections

**High Risk Factors**:
- ⚠️ Unknown template quality (expect many low scores)

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Batch processing to manage time
- Flexible plan accommodates additional templates
- 16-section framework provides objectivity
- Low quality is expected outcome (validates strategy)

**Assessment**: Moderate risk, primarily time-related, with good mitigations in place.

**Score**: 2/3 (medium risk, well-mitigated)

---

### 4. Dependencies: 1/2

**External Dependencies**:
- ✅ `/template-validate` command (TASK-044) - **COMPLETE**
- ⚪ Template validation framework - **IMPLEMENTED**
- ⚪ Existing templates - **AVAILABLE**

**Dependency Status**: All required dependencies are met.

**Optional Dependencies**:
- TASK-045 (AI-assisted validation) - **NOT REQUIRED**

**Integration Points**:
- File system access (read templates)
- Command execution (`/template-validate`)
- Document generation (markdown)

**Assessment**: Minimal dependencies, all prerequisites met.

**Score**: 1/2 (few dependencies, all satisfied)

## Total Complexity Score

| Category | Score | Max | Percentage |
|----------|-------|-----|------------|
| File Complexity | 2 | 3 | 67% |
| Pattern Familiarity | 1 | 2 | 50% |
| Risk Assessment | 2 | 3 | 67% |
| Dependencies | 1 | 2 | 50% |
| **Total** | **6** | **10** | **60%** |

**Final Score**: 6/10

---

## Complexity Level Classification

**6/10 = MEDIUM Complexity**

**Characteristics**:
- 4-8 hours per day estimated effort
- 3-5 days total duration
- Moderate file count
- Some learning curve for audit framework
- Well-mitigated risks
- Clear, documented process

**Complexity Tier**: Medium (4-6 on 0-10 scale)

---

## Review Mode Determination

**Threshold Analysis**:
- **1-3 (Simple)**: AUTO_PROCEED ❌
- **4-6 (Medium)**: QUICK_OPTIONAL (30s timeout) ✅ **← APPLIES**
- **7-10 (Complex)**: FULL_REQUIRED (mandatory checkpoint) ❌

**Recommendation**: QUICK_OPTIONAL review

**Action**:
- ✅ Skip Phase 2.8 (Human Checkpoint) - Not required for complexity 6/10
- ✅ Proceed directly to Phase 3 (Implementation)
- ⚪ Optional: User can request review if desired

---

## Effort Estimation

**Estimated Effort**: 3-5 days (24-40 hours)

**Breakdown by Phase**:
| Phase | Hours | Days |
|-------|-------|------|
| Phase 1: Discovery | 4 | 0.5 |
| Phase 2: Batch 1 (5 templates) | 12 | 1.5 |
| Phase 3: Batch 2 (4 templates) | 8 | 1.0 |
| Phase 4: Comparative Analysis | 8 | 1.0 |
| Phase 5: Removal Plan | 4 | 0.5 |
| Phase 6: Documentation | 4 | 0.5 |
| **Total** | **40** | **5** |

**Confidence Level**: High (based on well-defined process)

**Assumptions**:
- ~2-2.5 hours per template audit
- ~1 hour per analysis document
- 8-hour working days
- No major blockers or issues

## Complexity Factors Analysis

### Factors Increasing Complexity

1. **Manual Process** (+1 complexity)
   - Interactive audit requires human oversight
   - 16 sections per template (comprehensive)
   - Potential for 2-3 hours per template

2. **Volume** (+0.5 complexity)
   - 9 templates minimum
   - Possibly more discovered during audit
   - Multiple deliverables per template

3. **Analysis Required** (+0.5 complexity)
   - Comparative analysis requires synthesis
   - Pattern identification across templates
   - Strategic recommendations needed

### Factors Decreasing Complexity

1. **Existing Tooling** (-1 complexity)
   - `/template-validate` handles technical validation
   - Auto-generated reports
   - Well-tested framework (109 tests)

2. **Clear Process** (-0.5 complexity)
   - Documented 16-section framework
   - Examples provided
   - Systematic approach

3. **No Code Required** (-1 complexity)
   - No implementation work
   - Document creation only
   - Uses existing commands

**Net Complexity**: 6/10 (balanced factors)

---

## Decision

**Complexity Rating**: ✅ **6/10 (MEDIUM) - CONFIRMED**

**Phase 2.8 Checkpoint**: ❌ **NOT REQUIRED**

**Reasoning**:
- Complexity below 7/10 threshold
- Well-documented process reduces uncertainty
- Existing tooling mitigates technical risk
- Clear deliverables and acceptance criteria

**Action**: **PROCEED TO PHASE 3 (IMPLEMENTATION)**

---

## Monitoring Points

During implementation, monitor for complexity escalation:

**Watch for**:
1. Template audits taking >3 hours each
2. Discovery of significantly more than 9 templates
3. Command issues or failures
4. Unclear audit framework sections

**Escalation Triggers**:
- If >15 templates discovered → Re-evaluate timeline
- If command failures → Escalate to TASK-044 review
- If audits consistently exceed 3 hours → Consider batching or section selection

**Current Status**: ✅ Ready to proceed

**Evaluation Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Complexity**: 6/10 (MEDIUM)
**Checkpoint Required**: ❌ NO
**Next Phase**: Phase 3 (Implementation)
