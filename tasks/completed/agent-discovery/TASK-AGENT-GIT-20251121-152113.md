## Overview

Create new `git-workflow-manager.md` agent to cover Git workflow patterns, addressing the 6th core area from GitHub's best practices analysis (currently 0% coverage).

**Current Problem**:
- No agent covers Git workflow, branching, commits, or PRs
- Developers inconsistent with commit messages, branch naming
- PR workflow unclear (when to create, what to include)
- Missing from GitHub's "six core areas" (Commands, Testing, Structure, Style, Git, Boundaries)

**GitHub's Six Core Areas**:
1. Commands ✅
2. Testing ✅
3. Project Structure ✅
4. Code Style ⚠️ (scattered)
5. **Git Workflow** ✅ COMPLETED
6. Boundaries ❌ (TASK-AGENT-BOUND)

**Impact**: Standardizes Git workflow, improves commit quality, clarifies PR process
