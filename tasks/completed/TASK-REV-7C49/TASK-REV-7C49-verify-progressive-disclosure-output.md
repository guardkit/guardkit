# Task: Verify Progressive Disclosure Output from Template-Create and Agent-Enhance Commands

## Description

Review and validate the output files generated by the `/template-create` and `/agent-enhance` commands in the progressive disclosure test directory. This review task will verify that:

1. The template structure is correct and complete
2. Agent files follow the progressive disclosure pattern (core + extended files)
3. All required sections are present and properly formatted
4. ALWAYS/NEVER/ASK boundary sections are correctly implemented
5. Code examples are meaningful and compilable
6. The split between core and extended content is appropriate

## Review Scope

### Files to Review

**Template Structure** (`docs/reviews/progressive-disclosure/javascript-standard-structure-template/`):
- `CLAUDE.md` - Core template instructions
- `manifest.json` - Template manifest
- `settings.json` - Template settings
- `docs/patterns/README.md` - Pattern documentation
- `docs/reference/README.md` - Reference documentation
- `templates/` - Code templates directory

**Agent Files** (Progressive Disclosure Pattern):
- `agents/svelte5-component-specialist.md` (core)
- `agents/svelte5-component-specialist-ext.md` (extended)
- `agents/alasql-in-memory-db-specialist.md` (core)
- `agents/alasql-in-memory-db-specialist-ext.md` (extended)
- `agents/firebase-firestore-specialist.md` (core)
- `agents/firebase-firestore-specialist-ext.md` (extended)
- `agents/external-api-integration-specialist.md` (core)
- `agents/external-api-integration-specialist-ext.md` (extended)
- `agents/smui-material-ui-specialist.md` (core)
- `agents/smui-material-ui-specialist-ext.md` (extended)
- `agents/pwa-vite-specialist.md` (core, no extended)
- `agents/openai-function-calling-specialist.md` (core, no extended)

**Agent Enhance Output** (`docs/reviews/progressive-disclosure/agent-ehance-output/`):
- `api.md`
- `aopenai.md`
- `smui.md`
- `pwa.md`
- `alasql.md`
- `firebase.md`
- `svelete.md`

**Template Create Log**:
- `docs/reviews/progressive-disclosure/template_create.md`

## Acceptance Criteria

### Template Structure Validation
- [ ] `CLAUDE.md` contains core instructions with loading instructions for extended content
- [ ] `manifest.json` has valid schema and complete metadata
- [ ] `settings.json` contains appropriate template settings
- [ ] `docs/` structure follows progressive disclosure pattern

### Agent Core File Validation (for each agent)
- [ ] Valid frontmatter with required fields (stack, phase, capabilities, keywords)
- [ ] Quick Start section with 5-10 code examples
- [ ] ALWAYS/NEVER/ASK boundary sections present and complete
  - [ ] 5-7 ALWAYS rules with ✅ prefix
  - [ ] 5-7 NEVER rules with ❌ prefix
  - [ ] 3-5 ASK scenarios with ⚠️ prefix
- [ ] Capabilities summary section
- [ ] Phase integration section
- [ ] Loading instructions for extended content

### Agent Extended File Validation (for agents with -ext.md)
- [ ] 30+ detailed code examples
- [ ] Best practices with full explanations
- [ ] Anti-patterns with code samples
- [ ] Technology-specific guidance
- [ ] Troubleshooting scenarios

### Content Quality Validation
- [ ] Code examples are syntactically correct
- [ ] Examples demonstrate real usage patterns from template source
- [ ] "Why This Agent Exists" is meaningful (not circular)
- [ ] Integration guidance includes practical usage examples
- [ ] No placeholder or TODO content in production sections

### Progressive Disclosure Compliance
- [ ] Core files are <2000 tokens (estimated)
- [ ] Extended files contain detailed reference material
- [ ] Clear loading instructions in core files
- [ ] Content split follows 55-60% token reduction target

## Review Mode

**Mode**: code-quality
**Depth**: standard (1-2 hours)

## Analysis Focus Areas

1. **Structural Compliance**: Does the output match the progressive disclosure specification?
2. **Content Quality**: Are the generated sections meaningful and useful?
3. **Code Example Quality**: Are examples real and compilable?
4. **Boundary Section Quality**: Do ALWAYS/NEVER/ASK sections follow the GitHub best practices format?
5. **Token Efficiency**: Does the split achieve the target token reduction?

## Decision Options

After review, recommend one of:
- **[A]ccept**: Output meets quality standards, progressive disclosure implemented correctly
- **[R]evise**: Specific improvements needed (document in findings)
- **[I]mplement**: Create implementation tasks to fix identified issues
- **[C]ancel**: Fundamental issues require command redesign

## Implementation Notes

This review will inform improvements to:
- `/template-create` command (Phase 5-7)
- `/agent-enhance` command
- Progressive disclosure documentation
- Agent content quality standards
