# Task: Update feature-spec-command README task statuses

## Description

The README at `tasks/backlog/feature-spec-command/README.md` shows all three implementation tasks (TASK-FS-001, TASK-FS-002, TASK-FS-003) as `backlog`, but they have all been completed. Update the statuses to reflect reality.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] TASK-FS-001 status updated to `completed`
- [x] TASK-FS-002 status updated to `completed`
- [x] TASK-FS-003 status updated to `completed`
- [x] Next Steps section updated to reflect completion

## Files to Change

- `tasks/backlog/feature-spec-command/README.md`
