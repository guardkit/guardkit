# Task: Create Extended Files for PWA and OpenAI Agents

## BLOCKED

**Reason**: This task was created based on incorrect assumptions from TASK-REV-7C49.

**Problem Discovered**:
- The task description states files are "~518 lines" and "~736 lines, comprehensive"
- **Actual state**: Both agent files are stubs (~30 lines each)
- There is no comprehensive content to split into core + extended files
- The content should have been generated by AI codebase analysis during `/agent-enhance` or `/template-create`

**Blocking Task**: TASK-REV-8A3F - Review agent-enhance command output quality

**Resolution Options** (after TASK-REV-8A3F completes):
1. **Cancel this task** - If agent-enhance is fixed and can generate the content properly
2. **Revise this task** - If manual content creation is still needed for some reason
3. **Re-run agent-enhance** - Generate proper content from codebase analysis, then split if needed

## Original Description (for reference)

Split `pwa-vite-specialist.md` and `openai-function-calling-specialist.md` into core + extended files to maintain consistency with other agents in the `javascript-standard-structure-template`.

**Source**: Review finding from TASK-REV-7C49

## Current State (CORRECTED)

Both agents are **stubs**, not comprehensive files:
- `agents/pwa-vite-specialist.md` (~30 lines, stub - NOT 518 lines)
- `agents/openai-function-calling-specialist.md` (~32 lines, stub - NOT 736 lines)

## Target State

Each agent should have:
1. **Core file** (`{name}.md`): ~200-250 lines
   - Frontmatter with discovery metadata
   - Quick Start (5-10 examples)
   - Boundaries (ALWAYS/NEVER/ASK)
   - Capabilities summary
   - Loading instructions for extended content

2. **Extended file** (`{name}-ext.md`): ~400-600 lines
   - Detailed code examples (30+)
   - Best practices with explanations
   - Anti-patterns with code samples
   - Troubleshooting scenarios

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `pwa-vite-specialist-ext.md` created with detailed content
- [ ] `pwa-vite-specialist.md` trimmed to core content only
- [ ] `openai-function-calling-specialist-ext.md` created with detailed content
- [ ] `openai-function-calling-specialist.md` trimmed to core content only
- [ ] Both core files include loading instructions: `cat agents/{name}-ext.md`
- [ ] Token reduction achieved (~55-70% for core files)

## Implementation Notes

Location: `~/.agentecflow/templates/javascript-standard-structure-template/agents/`

Use existing agents as reference:
- `external-api-integration-specialist.md` + `-ext.md`
- `firebase-firestore-specialist.md` + `-ext.md`

## Estimated Effort

**REVISED**: Cannot estimate until TASK-REV-8A3F determines if agent-enhance can generate content automatically.
