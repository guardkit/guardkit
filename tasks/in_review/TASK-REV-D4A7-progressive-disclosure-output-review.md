# Task: Review progressive disclosure output from template-create and agent-enhance commands

## Description

Analyze the output generated by running `/template-create` and `/agent-enhance` commands on a .NET MAUI project (mydrive). This review will assess the quality, completeness, and correctness of the generated artifacts to validate the progressive disclosure implementation.

## Scope

### Files to Review

**Template Create Output:**
- `docs/reviews/progressive-disclosure/template-create-output.md` - Command execution log

**Generated Template Files:**
- `docs/reviews/progressive-disclosure/mydrive/CLAUDE.md` - Generated project instructions
- `docs/reviews/progressive-disclosure/mydrive/manifest.json` - Template manifest
- `docs/reviews/progressive-disclosure/mydrive/settings.json` - Template settings
- `docs/reviews/progressive-disclosure/mydrive/templates/**/*.template` - Code templates (10 files)

**Agent Enhancement Output (7 agents):**
1. `agent-enhance-output/maui-mvvm-viewmodel-specialist.md`
2. `agent-enhance-output/realm-repository-specialist.md`
3. `agent-enhance-output/error-or-railway-specialist.md`
4. `agent-enhance-output/business-logic-engine-specialist.md`
5. `agent-enhance-output/http-api-service-specialist.md`
6. `agent-enhance-output/reactive-extensions-specialist.md`
7. `agent-enhance-output/xunit-nsubstitute-testing-specialist.md`

**Generated Agent Files (core + extended for each):**
- `mydrive/agents/{agent-name}.md` - Core agent files (7 files)
- `mydrive/agents/{agent-name}-ext.md` - Extended reference files (7 files)

## Review Criteria

### 1. Template Create Quality (30%)

- [ ] CLAUDE.md completeness and accuracy
- [ ] Manifest.json validity and structure
- [ ] Settings.json correctness
- [ ] Code template extraction accuracy
- [ ] Progressive disclosure structure (core vs docs/)

### 2. Agent Enhancement Quality (40%)

For each of the 7 agents:
- [ ] Core file contains essential Quick Start examples (5-10)
- [ ] Core file includes ALWAYS/NEVER/ASK boundary sections
- [ ] Extended file contains detailed examples (30+)
- [ ] Best practices section completeness
- [ ] Anti-patterns section with code samples
- [ ] Technology-specific guidance accuracy

### 3. Progressive Disclosure Compliance (20%)

- [ ] Token reduction achieved (target: 55-60%)
- [ ] Core files are self-sufficient for common tasks
- [ ] Extended files provide comprehensive reference
- [ ] Loading instructions are clear and correct

### 4. .NET MAUI Stack Accuracy (10%)

- [ ] Patterns match .NET MAUI best practices
- [ ] Realm database patterns are correct
- [ ] ErrorOr/Railway pattern implementation
- [ ] ReactiveUI patterns accuracy
- [ ] NSubstitute testing patterns

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All generated files are syntactically valid
- [ ] Agent boundary sections follow ALWAYS/NEVER/ASK format
- [ ] Code examples compile (conceptually valid C#)
- [ ] Progressive disclosure split is appropriate
- [ ] No placeholder or incomplete content
- [ ] Documentation cross-references are correct

## Deliverables

1. **Quality Assessment Report** - Scoring each component (0-10)
2. **Issues List** - Specific problems found with remediation suggestions
3. **Recommendations** - Improvements for template-create and agent-enhance commands

## Implementation Notes

This is a review/analysis task. Use `/task-review` for execution.
