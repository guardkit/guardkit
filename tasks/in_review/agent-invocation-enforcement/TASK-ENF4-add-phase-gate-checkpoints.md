# Task: Add Phase Gate Checkpoints to task-work

## Context

**From TASK-8D3F Review**: The `/task-work` command currently allows phases to complete without verifying that the required agent was actually invoked. This creates a gap where:
1. Claude can complete implementation directly without invoking the implementation agent
2. Claude can update tests directly without invoking the testing agent
3. Protocol violations are not detected until final report generation (if at all)
4. No opportunity to correct the issue mid-execution

**Issue**: No mid-execution validation exists to verify agent usage after each phase.

**Priority**: HIGH - Prevents protocol bypass during execution, catches violations early.

## Objective

Add validation checkpoints after each phase that:
1. Verify the phase's agent was actually invoked via Task tool
2. Block progression to next phase if agent was not invoked
3. Provide clear error messages explaining the violation
4. Move task to BLOCKED state when violations are detected

## Requirements

### R1: Phase Gate Validation Function

**Requirement**: Create function to validate phase completion

**Implementation**:
```python
# File: installer/global/commands/lib/phase_gate_validator.py

from typing import Optional
from .agent_invocation_tracker import AgentInvocationTracker

class PhaseGateValidator:
    """
    Validates that agents were properly invoked after each phase.

    Prevents progression to next phase if current phase's agent
    was not invoked via Task tool.
    """

    def __init__(self, tracker: AgentInvocationTracker):
        self.tracker = tracker

    def validate_phase_completion(self, phase: str, phase_name: str) -> bool:
        """
        Validate that the current phase's agent was actually invoked.

        This runs AFTER each phase to ensure Task tool was used.

        Args:
            phase: Phase identifier (e.g., "3", "4", "5")
            phase_name: Human-readable phase name (e.g., "Implementation")

        Raises:
            ValidationError: If phase agent was not invoked

        Returns:
            bool: True if validation passes
        """
        # Check if phase was completed in tracker
        phase_invocations = [
            inv for inv in self.tracker.invocations
            if inv["phase"] == phase and inv["status"] == "completed"
        ]

        if len(phase_invocations) == 0:
            raise ValidationError(
                self._format_violation_error(phase, phase_name)
            )

        # Validation passed
        print(f"✅ Phase {phase} Gate: Agent invocation confirmed\n")
        return True

    def _format_violation_error(self, phase: str, phase_name: str) -> str:
        """
        Format detailed error message for phase gate violation.

        Args:
            phase: Phase identifier
            phase_name: Human-readable phase name

        Returns:
            Formatted error message
        """
        expected_agent = self._get_expected_agent(phase)

        return f"""
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
❌ PHASE GATE VIOLATION: Phase {phase} agent not invoked
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The protocol requires using the Task tool to invoke a specialized agent.
Phase {phase} ({phase_name}) appears to have been completed without agent invocation.

Expected: INVOKE Task tool with subagent_type='{expected_agent}'
Actual: No Task tool invocation detected

Cannot proceed to next phase until Phase {phase} agent is invoked.

Please invoke the agent using:
  subagent_type: "{expected_agent}"
  description: "{self._get_phase_description(phase)}"
  prompt: "..."

TASK MOVED TO BLOCKED STATE

            "5": "Review TASK-XXX implementation"
        }
        return descriptions.get(phase, "Execute phase")
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Validator class created in `installer/global/commands/lib/phase_gate_validator.py`
- [ ] `validate_phase_completion()` method checks for completed invocations
- [ ] Method raises `ValidationError` if phase agent not invoked
- [ ] Error message is detailed and actionable
- [ ] Error message shows expected agent and invocation format

### R2: Integration with task-work.md

**Requirement**: Add phase gate validation after each phase completes

**Location**: After each phase's "WAIT for agent to complete" section in `task-work.md`

**Phase 3 Example**:
```markdown
#### Phase 3: Implementation

**INVOKE** Task tool:
```
subagent_type: "{selected_implementation_agent_from_table}"
description: "Implement TASK-XXX"
...
```

**WAIT** for agent to complete before proceeding.

**PHASE GATE VALIDATION** (NEW):
```python
try:
    validator.validate_phase_completion("3", "Implementation")
except ValidationError as e:
    print(str(e))
    move_task_to_blocked(task_id, reason=f"Phase 3 gate violation - agent not invoked")
    exit(1)
```

**IF validation passes**: Proceed to Phase 4
**IF validation fails**: Task moved to BLOCKED, execution stops
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Phase gate added after Phase 2
- [ ] Phase gate added after Phase 2.5B
- [ ] Phase gate added after Phase 3
- [ ] Phase gate added after Phase 4
- [ ] Phase gate added after Phase 5
- [ ] Each gate uses correct phase identifier and name

### R3: Success Message Display

**Requirement**: Display confirmation when phase gate passes

**Expected Output** (Success):
```
✅ Phase 3 Gate: Agent invocation confirmed

Proceeding to Phase 4 (Testing)...
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Success message displayed when validation passes
- [ ] Message includes phase number and confirmation
- [ ] Message indicates next phase
- [ ] Message uses ✅ emoji for easy scanning

### R4: Error Message Display

**Requirement**: Display detailed error when phase gate fails

**Expected Output** (Failure):
```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
❌ PHASE GATE VIOLATION: Phase 3 agent not invoked
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The protocol requires using the Task tool to invoke a specialized agent.
Phase 3 (Implementation) appears to have been completed without agent invocation.

Expected: INVOKE Task tool with subagent_type='python-api-specialist'
Actual: No Task tool invocation detected

Cannot proceed to next phase until Phase 3 agent is invoked.

Please invoke the agent using:
  subagent_type: "python-api-specialist"
  description: "Implement TASK-XXX"
  prompt: "..."

TASK MOVED TO BLOCKED STATE
Reason: Phase gate violation - Phase 3 agent not invoked
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Error clearly states "Phase gate violation"
- [ ] Error identifies which phase failed (number and name)
- [ ] Error shows expected vs actual invocation
- [ ] Error provides exact invocation format needed
- [ ] Error explains task is moved to BLOCKED state

### R5: Early Detection vs Late Detection

**Requirement**: Phase gates catch violations earlier than pre-report validation

**Comparison**:

| Detection Method | When Detected | Benefit |
|------------------|---------------|---------|
| **Phase Gates** (TASK-ENF4) | After each phase | Immediate feedback, can retry invocation |
| **Pre-Report Validation** (TASK-ENF1) | Before final report | Prevents false reporting |

**Design**: Both mechanisms should exist:
- Phase gates provide immediate feedback during execution
- Pre-report validation provides final safety net

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Phase gates catch violations during execution (Phases 2-5)
- [ ] Pre-report validation catches any violations that slipped through
- [ ] Both mechanisms provide consistent error messages
- [ ] Task BLOCKED state set in both cases

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Create Validator Class

**Files**:
- `installer/global/commands/lib/phase_gate_validator.py` (new)
- `installer/global/commands/lib/__init__.py` (modify - add import)

**Implementation**:
1. Create `PhaseGateValidator` class
2. Implement `validate_phase_completion()` method
3. Implement `_format_violation_error()` helper
4. Implement `_get_expected_agent()` and `_get_phase_description()` helpers
5. Add unit tests for validator

### Phase 2: Integrate with Phase 3

**Files**:
- `installer/global/commands/task-work.md` (modify)

**Implementation**:
1. Add validator initialization before Phase 2
2. Add phase gate validation after Phase 3 completes
3. Test validation with agent invoked (should pass)
4. Test validation without agent invoked (should fail)

### Phase 3: Integrate with All Phases

**Files**:
- `installer/global/commands/task-work.md` (modify)

**Implementation**:
1. Add phase gate after Phase 2
2. Add phase gate after Phase 2.5B
3. Add phase gate after Phase 4
4. Add phase gate after Phase 5
5. Ensure consistent error handling across all gates

### Phase 4: Testing

**Test Cases**:
1. **Standard workflow - all agents invoked** → All gates pass, task completes
2. **Standard workflow - Phase 3 agent skipped** → Phase 3 gate fails, task BLOCKED
3. **Standard workflow - Phase 4 agent skipped** → Phase 4 gate fails, task BLOCKED
4. **Micro workflow** → Only relevant gates validate (adjust for micro mode)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] All test cases produce correct behavior
- [ ] Gate failures block progression to next phase
- [ ] Error messages are clear and actionable
- [ ] Task state transitions are correct (BLOCKED on failure)

## Success Criteria

### SC1: Mid-Execution Validation

- [ ] Validation runs after each phase completes
- [ ] Violations detected immediately (not delayed until final report)
- [ ] User receives immediate feedback on protocol violations

### SC2: Phase Progression Blocked

- [ ] Task cannot proceed to next phase if current phase's agent not invoked
- [ ] Clear error message explains what's required
- [ ] Task moved to BLOCKED state when gate fails

### SC3: Early Detection

- [ ] Protocol violations caught during execution (not at end)
- [ ] User has opportunity to correct issue (re-invoke agent)
- [ ] Prevents accumulation of violations across multiple phases

### SC4: Consistent with Pre-Report Validation

- [ ] Error messages consistent between phase gates and pre-report validation
- [ ] Both mechanisms set BLOCKED state with same reason format
- [ ] Phase gates serve as "early warning", pre-report validation as "final safety net"

## Estimated Effort

**Total**: 6-8 hours

**Breakdown**:
- Phase 1 (Validator Class): 3 hours
- Phase 2 (Phase 3 Integration): 1 hour
- Phase 3 (All Phases Integration): 2 hours
- Phase 4 (Testing): 1-2 hours

## Related Tasks

- TASK-8D3F - Review task that identified this gap
- TASK-ENF2 - Add agent invocation tracking (prerequisite for this task)
- TASK-ENF1 - Add pre-report validation (complementary final safety net)
- TASK-5F8A - Review and improve subagent invocation enforcement

## Notes

**Dependencies**: This task requires TASK-ENF2 (Agent Invocation Tracking) to be implemented first, as it relies on the `AgentInvocationTracker` to verify invocations.

**Implementation Order**: Complete TASK-ENF2 before starting this task.

**Testing**: Use MyDrive TASK-ROE-007g scenario as test case:
- Phase 2 gate should PASS (agent was invoked)
- Phase 2.5B gate should PASS (architectural-reviewer invoked)
- Phase 3 gate should FAIL (no agent invocation detected) → Task BLOCKED
- Execution should stop before Phase 4

**Complementary with TASK-ENF1**: Phase gates provide immediate feedback during execution, while pre-report validation (TASK-ENF1) provides final safety net. Both should be implemented.
