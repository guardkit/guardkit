# Task: Trim dataclasses.md and pydantic-models.md After Graphiti Verification

## Description

Reduce dataclasses.md from ~720 to ~360 tokens and pydantic-models.md from ~584 to ~320 tokens by migrating secondary patterns to Graphiti while keeping primary patterns static.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] PREREQUISITE: TASK-CR-006 complete and pattern code examples retrievable from Graphiti
- [ ] dataclasses.md: Keep basic state containers, optional fields, JSON serialization, field() usage, When to Use table. Migrate: common patterns, computed properties, loading from JSON
- [ ] pydantic-models.md: Keep basic model structure, field definitions, nested models (condensed), When to Use table. Migrate: serialization, JSON schema examples, dynamic defaults, custom exceptions
- [ ] If Graphiti code retrieval fidelity is poor: ABORT, keep files as-is

## Implementation Notes

Combined estimated savings: ~624 tokens (conditional on path-gated load)

Same caveat as TASK-CR-007: abort if code retrieval fidelity from Graphiti is insufficient.
