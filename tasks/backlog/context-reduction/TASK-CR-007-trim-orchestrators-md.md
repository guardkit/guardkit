# Task: Trim orchestrators.md After Graphiti Verification

## Description

Reduce orchestrators.md from ~385 lines (~1,540 tokens) to ~80 lines (~320 tokens) by keeping only the primary patterns (Pipeline Step Execution, State Management condensed) and migrating detailed code examples to Graphiti.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] PREREQUISITE: TASK-CR-006 complete and orchestrator patterns retrievable from Graphiti with >0.6 relevance
- [ ] orchestrators.md reduced to ~80 lines
- [ ] Retained: Pipeline Step Execution (condensed to 80 tokens), State Management (condensed to 40 tokens), "When to use" guidance for each pattern
- [ ] Migrated to Graphiti: Checkpoint-Resume full code, Validation Chain full code, Error Recovery, Progress Reporting, Strategy Routing
- [ ] If Graphiti code retrieval fidelity is poor: ABORT this task, keep file as-is

## Implementation Notes

Estimated savings: ~1,220 tokens (conditional on path-gated load)

IMPORTANT: If TASK-CR-006 reveals that Graphiti doesn't preserve Python code formatting well enough, this task should be cancelled. The pattern files are already path-gated, so the savings are conditional anyway.
