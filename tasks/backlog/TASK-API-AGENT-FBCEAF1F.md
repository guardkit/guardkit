# Task: Enhance api-agent Agent with Boundary Sections

## Description

Enhance the `api-agent` agent generated by `/template-init` to include comprehensive ALWAYS/NEVER/ASK boundary sections with technology-specific rules.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Agent includes 5-7 ALWAYS rules with ✅ prefix
- [ ] Agent includes 5-7 NEVER rules with ❌ prefix
- [ ] Agent includes 3-5 ASK scenarios with ⚠️ prefix
- [ ] All rules have brief rationales in parentheses
- [ ] Boundaries are python-specific
- [ ] Rules are actionable and specific

## Enhancement Options

**Option A (Recommended - Fast)**:
```bash
/agent-enhance my-template/api-agent --hybrid
```
Duration: 2-5 minutes per agent

**Option B (Optional - Full Workflow)**:
```bash
/task-work TASK-API-AGENT-FBCEAF1F
```
Duration: 30-60 minutes with full quality gates

Both options use the same AI enhancement logic with boundary validation.
