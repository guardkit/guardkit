# Create Quickstart Video Tutorial

**Priority**: Enhancement
**Category**: Documentation - Multimedia
**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours (production)

## Problem

Visual learners would benefit from a screencast showing GuardKit in action. A 5-10 minute video tutorial can demonstrate the complete workflow more effectively than text for many users.

## Video Content Outline

### 1. Introduction (30 seconds)
- What is GuardKit?
- Why use it?
- What you'll learn

### 2. Installation (1 minute)
- Show quick install command
- Demonstrate initialization
- Verify installation

### 3. First Task Workflow (3 minutes)
- Create a simple task
- Run `/task-work` and show all phases
- Highlight quality gates in action
- Complete the task
- Show generated code

### 4. Key Features Demo (3 minutes)
- Hash-based task IDs
- Stack detection
- Architectural review
- Test enforcement
- Plan audit

### 5. Advanced Preview (1 minute)
- Design-first workflow teaser
- Parallel development teaser
- Review workflow teaser
- Link to advanced documentation

### 6. Next Steps (30 seconds)
- Documentation links
- Template customization
- Community resources
