# Task: Verify Progressive Disclosure and Rules Structure Implementation Output

## Description

Comprehensive review of the output from `/template-create`, `/agent-enhance`, and `guardkit init` commands to verify the progressive disclosure and Claude rules structure implementations are working correctly.

This review task analyzes actual command output artifacts in `docs/reviews/progressive-disclosure/` to validate:
1. Template creation produces correct rules structure
2. Agent enhancement generates proper progressive disclosure format
3. `guardkit init mydrive` correctly initializes projects with the new structure

## Review Scope

### 1. Template Create Output Analysis
**Location**: `docs/reviews/progressive-disclosure/template-create-output.md`

Verify:
- [ ] Rules structure is generated by default (TASK-TC-DEFAULT-FLAGS)
- [ ] Output includes `.claude/rules/` directory structure
- [ ] Path-specific loading metadata is present in rule files
- [ ] Core CLAUDE.md is slim (~5KB target)
- [ ] Extended content is properly split into rules/

### 2. Agent Enhance Output Analysis
**Location**: `docs/reviews/progressive-disclosure/agent-enhance-output/`

Files to review:
- `http-api-service-specialist.md` (15KB)
- `business-logic-engine-specialist.md` (28KB)
- `erroror-railway-oriented-programming-specialist.md` (23KB)
- `maui-mvvm-viewmodel-specialist.md` (20KB)
- `maui-xaml-ui-specialist.md` (23KB)
- `reactive-extensions-rx-specialist.md` (23KB)
- `realm-repository-specialist.md` (5KB)
- `riok-mapperly-code-generator-specialist.md` (22KB)
- `xunit-nsubstitute-testing-specialist.md` (5KB)

Verify for each agent:
- [ ] ALWAYS/NEVER/ASK boundary sections present and properly formatted
- [ ] Quick Start examples (5-10 minimum)
- [ ] Capabilities summary
- [ ] Phase integration documented
- [ ] Loading instructions for extended content
- [ ] Proper frontmatter with required fields
- [ ] Template-specific code examples

### 3. Guardkit Init Mydrive Output Analysis
**Location**: `docs/reviews/progressive-disclosure/guardkit-init-mydrive/`

Verify:
- [ ] `.claude/` directory structure created correctly
- [ ] Rules structure present (if enabled)
- [ ] CLAUDE.md properly generated
- [ ] Init output log shows expected phases

### 4. Mydrive Template Analysis
**Location**: `docs/reviews/progressive-disclosure/mydrive/`

Verify:
- [ ] Template manifest.json is valid
- [ ] Settings.json properly configured
- [ ] Agents directory contains enhanced agents
- [ ] `.claude/` template structure is correct

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Template Create**:
   - Rules structure is default output format
   - 60-70% context reduction achieved vs single-file
   - Path-specific loading works correctly

2. **Agent Enhance**:
   - All agents have ALWAYS/NEVER/ASK boundaries
   - Boundary counts: 5-7 ALWAYS, 5-7 NEVER, 3-5 ASK
   - Emoji format used (✅/❌/⚠️)
   - Quick Start examples are template-specific, not generic

3. **Guardkit Init**:
   - Project initialization succeeds
   - Output structure matches expected format
   - No missing files or broken references

## Analysis Questions

1. Are the progressive disclosure splits reducing context window usage effectively?
2. Do the boundary sections provide clear guidance for agent behavior?
3. Is the rules structure organized logically for path-specific loading?
4. Are there any inconsistencies between template-create output and guardkit-init output?
5. Do enhanced agents maintain consistency across different specialists?

## Review Deliverables

1. Findings report with specific issues identified
2. Recommendations for improvements (if any)
3. Verification checklist completion status
4. Decision on implementation correctness

## Notes

- This is a verification review, not an implementation task
- Use `/task-review` workflow, not `/task-work`
- Output artifacts already exist - this is analysis only
