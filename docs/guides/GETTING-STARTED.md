# Getting Started with GuardKit

## Welcome to Feature Plan Development!

GuardKit is built on **Feature Plan Development (FPD)** — a feature-first workflow where a single `/feature-plan` command generates a complete, consistent plan, subtask breakdown, and implementation workspace. Built-in quality gates prevent broken code from reaching production.

## Quick Start (5 Minutes!)

### Step 1: Initialize Your Project
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/guardkit/guardkit.git
cd guardkit
chmod +x installer/scripts/install.sh
./installer/scripts/install.sh
```

> **Using Claude Code Web?** See the [Claude Code Web Setup Guide](claude-code-web-setup.md) for detailed web-specific instructions including persistence and multi-repository usage.

### Step 2: Plan Your First Feature (in Claude Code)

**For new features (recommended):**
```bash
# Plan a feature (single command!)
/feature-plan "add user authentication"

# System creates complete feature workspace:
# ✅ Review task with technical options
# ✅ Subtask breakdown with parallel waves
# ✅ Implementation guide
# ✅ Feature workspace in tasks/backlog/

# Work through generated subtasks
/task-work TASK-AUTH-001
/task-complete TASK-AUTH-001
```

**For simple tasks (direct):**
```bash
# Create a simple task
/task-create "Fix login button styling"

# Work on it (automatic planning + implementation + testing)
/task-work TASK-a3f8

# Complete it
/task-complete TASK-a3f8
```

The `/feature-plan` command handles feature decomposition, and `/task-work` handles planning, implementation, architectural review, testing, and quality verification automatically.

## What is GuardKit?

### The Core Features

**Workflow Automation**:
- Creates implementation plans automatically
- Performs architectural review (SOLID/DRY/YAGNI)
- Evaluates task complexity (1-10 scale)
- Implements code based on approved plans
- Runs comprehensive test suites
- Enforces quality gates (100% test pass, ≥80% coverage)

**State Management**:
```
BACKLOG → IN_PROGRESS → IN_REVIEW → COMPLETED
            ↓              ↓
         BLOCKED        BLOCKED
```

**Available Templates** (4 high-quality):
- **react-typescript**: React + TypeScript (from Bulletproof React, 9.3/10)
- **fastapi-python**: FastAPI + pytest (from best practices, 9.2/10)
- **nextjs-fullstack**: Next.js App Router (full-stack, 9.4/10)
- **default**: Language-agnostic (Go, Rust, Ruby, etc., 8.0+/10)

**For Production**: Use `/template-create` from your own codebase

## The Complete Development Flow

### 1. Create a Task
```bash
# Simple task creation
/task-create "Feature name"

# With priority
/task-create "Critical bug fix" priority:critical

# With tags
/task-create "Add logging" tags:infrastructure,logging
```

### 2. Work on the Task (One Command!)
```bash
# Standard mode (default)
/task-work TASK-001

# TDD mode (for complex logic)
/task-work TASK-001 --mode=tdd

# Design-first workflow (for complex tasks)
/task-work TASK-001 --design-only
# [Review and approve plan]
/task-work TASK-001 --implement-only
```

### 3. Complete the Task
```bash
# After review
/task-complete TASK-001
```

## Key Features Explained

### Automatic Quality Gates
| Gate | Threshold | Enforcement |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Compilation | 100% | Required |
| Tests Pass | 100% | Required |
| Line Coverage | ≥80% | Required |
| Branch Coverage | ≥75% | Required |
| Architectural Review | ≥60/100 | Required |

### Smart State Management
```
Tests Pass + Coverage Good → IN_REVIEW
Tests Fail → BLOCKED (auto-fix up to 3 attempts)
Coverage Low → Stay IN_PROGRESS
Architectural Issues → Human checkpoint
```

### Clear Feedback
```
✅ Task Work Complete - TASK-001
Tests: 15/15 passing
Coverage: 92%
Status: IN_PROGRESS → IN_REVIEW
Next: /task-complete TASK-001
```

## Real-World Example

### Implementing User Authentication with TDD

```bash
# 1. Create the task
/task-create "Implement user authentication" priority:high

# 2. Work on it with TDD
/task-work TASK-042 --mode=tdd

# Claude's response:
# 🔴 RED Phase: Creating 8 failing tests...
#    ❌ All tests failing (expected)
#
# 🟢 GREEN Phase: Implementing code...
#    ✅ 8/8 tests passing
#
# 🔵 REFACTOR Phase: Improving quality...
#    ✅ All tests still passing
#
# 📊 Coverage: 92%
# ✅ Task moved to IN_REVIEW

# 3. Complete the task
/task-complete TASK-042
```

Total time: ~2 minutes (vs ~10 minutes with manual workflow)

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Simple Feature
```bash
/task-create "Add user profile page"
/task-work TASK-050              # Standard mode by default
/task-complete TASK-050
```

### Scenario 2: Complex Business Logic
```bash
/task-create "Calculate tax rates"
/task-work TASK-051 --mode=tdd   # TDD for complex logic
/task-complete TASK-051
```

### Scenario 3: Bug Fix
```bash
/task-create "Fix login timeout" priority:critical
/task-work TASK-053               # Quick fix
/task-complete TASK-053
```

### Scenario 4: Design-First Workflow
```bash
/task-create "Refactor authentication system" priority:high
/task-work TASK-054 --design-only
# [Human reviews and approves plan]
/task-work TASK-054 --implement-only
/task-complete TASK-054
```

## Decision Tree

```
Need to implement a task?
    ↓
Is it complex (multiple files, new patterns)?
    Yes → /task-work --design-only (review plan first)
    No ↓
Is it complex business logic?
    Yes → /task-work --mode=tdd
    No → /task-work (standard)
```

## Common Workflows

Beyond the basic `/task-work` command, these specialized workflows handle specific scenarios:

**Trivial Tasks (typos, doc updates)**:
```bash
/task-work TASK-XXX --micro    # 3-5 min vs 15+ min, skips planning/review
```
Auto-detected for simple tasks. [Details: task-work.md](../../installer/core/commands/task-work.md#flag---micro)

**Iterative Refinement (minor tweaks)**:
```bash
/task-refine TASK-XXX          # Quick fixes after code review
```
For small adjustments without full re-work. [Details: GuardKit Workflow](guardkit-workflow.md#37-iterative-refinement)

**Analysis & Reviews (decisions, audits)**:
```bash
/task-review TASK-XXX --mode=architectural --depth=standard
```
For architectural reviews, security audits, technical decisions (no implementation). [Details: Task Review Workflow](../workflows/task-review-workflow.md)

> **Pro tip:** Start with `/task-work` for implementation. Use these specialized commands as you encounter specific needs.

## Essential Commands

### Feature Planning (Recommended Starting Point)
```bash
/feature-plan "feature description"    # Single command → complete feature plan
```

### Task Commands
```bash
/task-create "name" [priority:high|medium|low] [tags:tag1,tag2]
/task-work TASK-XXX [--mode=standard|tdd] [--design-only|--implement-only]
/task-complete TASK-XXX
/task-status [TASK-XXX]
/task-refine TASK-XXX
```

### Options for task-work
```bash
--mode=standard          # Default: implementation + tests
--mode=tdd              # Test-driven development cycle
--design-only           # Planning only (complex tasks)
--implement-only        # Implementation only (requires approved plan)
--no-questions          # Skip clarifying questions
--with-questions        # Force clarifying questions
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep tasks small** - 1-4 hour chunks work best
2. **Choose the right mode** - TDD for complex logic, standard for straightforward features
3. **Trust the process** - Let `/task-work` complete all phases
4. **Use design-first for complex tasks** - Review plans before implementation
5. **Review quality gates** - Don't skip architectural review feedback

## Quality Standards

All enforced automatically by `/task-work`:
- ✅ 100% of tasks have tests
- ✅ ≥80% code coverage
- ✅ All tests must pass
- ✅ Architectural review (SOLID/DRY/YAGNI)
- ✅ Proper documentation

## Technology Stack Support

**Reference templates** demonstrate patterns for:
- **react-typescript**: Vitest, Playwright, React Testing Library
- **fastapi-python**: pytest, FastAPI Test Client, Pydantic validation
- **nextjs-fullstack**: Vitest, Playwright, Next.js testing patterns
- **default**: Language-agnostic (configure for your stack)

**Your custom template** can use any stack via `/template-create`.

Reference templates for learning and evaluation:
```bash
# Stack-specific reference templates (9+/10 quality)
guardkit init react-typescript       # React + TypeScript (from Bulletproof React)
guardkit init fastapi-python         # FastAPI + pytest (from best practices)
guardkit init nextjs-fullstack       # Next.js App Router (full-stack)

# Language-agnostic template (8+/10 quality)
guardkit init default                # Go, Rust, Ruby, Elixir, PHP, etc.

# For production: Create from your codebase
cd your-production-codebase
/template-create
guardkit init your-custom-template
```
