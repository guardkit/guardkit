"""MCP Resources Package.

Resources are read-only data that MCP servers expose to clients.
Unlike tools (which perform actions), resources provide data access.

Example resources:
- Configuration data
- Documentation
- Status information
- Static datasets

Resources are optional - many MCP servers only implement tools.

# Add resource implementations here as needed
